# Description

Site for 2 people to keep score in a game. The users determine the winning score at the beginning and each user's score increments by 1. Once the winning score is reached:

i) The player buttons are disbaled and no longer function.
ii) The winning player's score font color changes to green.
iii) The losing player's score font color changes to red.

Enabling the buttons occurs in three ways:

i) Resetting the winning score to a new winning score.
ii) Clicking the reset button which does not change the score.
iii) Refreshing the page which resets the winning score to the default winning score of 3.

Bulma CSS Framework was used for styling.
